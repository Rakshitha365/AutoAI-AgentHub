# ðŸ¤– AutoAI Agent Framework
**An intelligent multi-agent automation system for AI application development.**

## Overview
The **AutoAI Agent Framework** is a prototype that automates the **entire machine learning pipeline** â€” from data preprocessing to model training and deployment â€” using **specialized AI agents**.  

Instead of manually handling each stage, this system allows users to simply upload a dataset and define the task type (classification or regression). The agents then work collaboratively to build, train, and deploy a working ML model automatically.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Automate core stages of AI app development:
  - Data preprocessing  
  - Model selection & training  
  - Deployment & prediction interface  
- Reduce technical complexity for users.  
- Provide a modular framework that can be extended with additional agents in the future.

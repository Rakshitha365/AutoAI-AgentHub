# AutoAI-AgentHub
This project demonstrates how specialized intelligent agents can collaborate to automate the complete machine learning workflow â€” from dataset preprocessing and model selection to deployment. Built using Python and scikit-learn, it enables users to generate ready-to-use ML solutions just by providing a dataset and specifying the problem type.
